How to map an ansible app onto a service object? Need some metadata query on
RHCC so that we can do a correct translation in the same way the template broker
is able to interogate Openshift.

Broker#provision actually responsible for doing the provisioning of an app?

Fair to think of service <-> AnsibleApp as analagous?
Only one AnsibleAppBroker, AnsibleAppBroker#catalog should return []Service,
where each service corresponds to one ansibleapp that we know about?
